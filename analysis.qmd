preceptor table:
  unit: individual mayor candidates 2000-2050
  potential outcomes: lived_after loss, lived_after won
  treatment: whether or not they won
  covariates: sex, age, political party

validity:
  These are governors not mayors
  
stability:
  life expectancy has changed from 1965
  
representativeness:
  losing candidates don't have nearly as much data as winning candidates
  
unconfoudedness:
  we do not control the disbursement of the treatment, (almost every covariate influences whether a candidate wins or loses)
